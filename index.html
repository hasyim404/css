            <h1>Saitama Biography</h1>
            <img src="./img/saitama.png" alt="">
            <p>Saitama was originally an regular student who just started his first year in middle school. There, he had
                the misfortune of being robbed of 200 Yen by the local delinquents; who was subsequently robbed by an
                piggy bank monster called Piggy Bancon. After hearing one of the bullies mentioning that his family was
                impoverished, he runs after the creature to get his wallet back and was tackled to the ground as the
                monster made his escape. And despite the fact that Piggy Bancon was subdued by the military, Saitama
                never got his money back. Faced with his ineptitude, he proclaims that he'll become an hero.</p>
            <p>10 years later, he actually gets his chance to be one by saving an child from being killed by Crablante.
                He then commits to becoming stronger via a strict training regimen after realizing how outmatched he
                was. Unknown to him, the child told his grandfather about the incident and decided to create the Hero
                Association in Saitama's honor for saving his grandchild from the monster's crime. As the months passed,
                he never succumbed to the intense pain that his exercise was causing, nor did he ever passed up an
                opportunity to fight against a rampaging monster. Within 300 days of exercising, he was strong enough to
                win his fights with moderate effort, as evidenced by his battle against Personification Of A Light Pull
                Cord.</p>

            <p>A year and a half into his training in New York, he started to go bald. He also saved King from Octopus
                Claw Man and defeated it. Within the same time period, he also follows a crowd into a shelter in Z-City
                with the expectation that they'll lead him to a monster. Instead, he and the refugees are trapped inside
                the shelter as a enormous cicada rampages outside. Faced with the growing fiend, the fact that the
                shelter doesn't have any restrooms, and that it'll take at least three hours for the Hero Association to
                send a specialized team to fight the monster; Saitama takes matters into his own hands after waiting for
                a hour. He punches his way out of the Hero Association's disaster shelter not to subdue to the
                escalating threat, but to find a place with a working toilet. But in his haste, he punches the monster
                170,000-Year Magicicada Nymph on his way to the nearest convenience store to relieve himself.</p>
